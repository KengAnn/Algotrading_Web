									<h2><a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio Dashboard</a></h2>

										<a href="https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/16b82039-ad9a-47fb-b291-89581db6040e/ReportSectionbe6d05afb027afb10558?ctid=5ba5ef5e-3109-4e77-85bd-cfeb0d347e82"><img src="images/portfolio.gif" width="870" height="570" alt="Portfolio Tracker"></a>

									<p> <br>
										Portfolio tracker is a powerful tool that enables traders to monitor and analyse their portfolio consolidated from various accounts.
									
										The top section allows users to slice and dice their data in different ways: 
										Firstly, if they trade in different markets and regions, they can easily choose the reporting currency by clicking on these buttons
										Next, they are able to filter their data in terms of the strategies, accounts and tickers with the 3 drop down list boxes.
										With the date slicer, user can choose the start and end dates freely to analyse their portfolio according to the time duration of interest.
									</p> <br>

									<h2><a href="portfolio.html">Profit and Returns</a></h2>
									<p>
										Starting from the left, these 2 cards displayed those information for them prominently. In addition, some interviewee wanted breakdown of the profits in different periods such as year to date, 1, 3 or max number of years. Although the information can be obtained by the date slicer, we incorporated a tooltip to make this information easily available. Hovering the mouse around the profit region will bring up the tooltip and display those detailed breakdown.
										The chart to the right let users visualize their portfolio value, realized and unrealized P&L over time graphically. At a glance, they would be able to tell how well their portfolio trends.
										On the rightmost, the current allocation by invested value is shown in a doughnut chart. If the allocation is skewed, users can make use of this information to rebalance their portfolio.
									</p> <br>

									<h2>Detailed Realised & Unrealised P&L</h2>
									<p>
										On the bottom left, we have decomposition trees for realized and unrealized P&L analysis. Users can drill down to know the constitutions of the P&L by the strategies employed. With a particular strategy, they can further view the components in terms of tickers invested. The branches list them in the order from the top to the worst performers. These breakdown allows users to know if certain instruments goes well with a particular strategy. Persistent poor performers can then be weeded out from the initial selection by a algo trading filter.
										Lastly, the account balance is shown at the bottom right hand corner. It helps to remind traders to top up their account with low balances should they decide to place trades with them.
